This project performs a detailed multivariate analysis on a dataset of 300 pizza samples from 10 different brands (Aâ€“J). Each sample contains nutritional metrics such as protein, fat, carbohydrate content, calories, and more. The objective is to explore variable relationships, detect multicollinearity, and apply Principal Components Analysis (PCA) to reduce dimensionality while preserving variance.

ðŸ›  Tools & Technologies
SAS: Used for all data manipulation, statistical testing, and visualization.

Pizza Dataset (pizza.csv): Contains nutritional information for 300 pizza samples.

ðŸ“Œ Objectives
Import and explore the nutritional dataset.

Detect and address multicollinearity using correlation analysis.

Perform PCA to reduce dimensionality and enhance model interpretability.

Compare full vs. reduced models in terms of variance explained and communality.

ðŸ“ˆ Methodology
Part 1: Data Import and Precorrelation Analysis
Imported pizza.csv into the SAS Work library.

Calculated pairwise correlations among mois, prot, fat, ash, sodium, carb, and cal.

Flagged sodium, ash, and one of prot or carb for removal due to high multicollinearity.

Part 2: Principal Components Analysis (PCA)
Initial PCA (mois, fat, carb, cal):

2 components retained (eigenvalues > 1), explaining 99.01% variance.

mois was identified as the weakest contributor.

Reduced PCA (fat, carb, cal):

1 component retained, explaining 69.3% of variance.

Model became more interpretable and parsimonious.

Evaluation
Calculated communality estimates for both full and reduced models.

Reduced model had higher average communality, indicating better explanatory power with fewer variables.

ðŸ“Š Key Findings
Strong correlation observed between fat, sodium, and ash, indicating redundancy.

Removing highly correlated variables significantly improved the PCA structure.

Reduced model not only simplified the analysis but also increased average communality from 0.5006 to 0.7705.

PCA proved effective in dimensionality reduction and insight generation from nutritional data.

âœ… Conclusion
This project successfully demonstrates how correlation analysis and PCA can be used in tandem to clean and streamline a high-dimensional dataset. The reduced model yielded better interpretability and stronger explanatory power, making it a strong candidate for further predictive modeling or clustering tasks in food science and nutritional research.

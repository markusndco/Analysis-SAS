# 📊 SAS Data Analysis & Modeling Projects

This repository contains a collection of **end-to-end SAS analytics projects** showcasing skills in data preparation, visualization, statistical analysis, and predictive modeling.  
Each project applies SAS programming to real-world-style datasets from `SASHELP` and external sources, covering topics from operational HR analytics to sports statistics, retail data, and nutritional analysis.
